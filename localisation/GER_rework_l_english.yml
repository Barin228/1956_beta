Many of them would like to see a change in Germany's political direction. Some of them lobby for a return of the German monarchy while others are opposed to National Socialism itself."

 GER_stance_on_versailles.1.t:0 "The Old Enemy"
 GER_stance_on_versailles.1.desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles, imposed on us after the defeat in the Weltkrieg has been a drain on Germany. Adolf Hitler had ignored most of its conditions but we must follow them if we want to be serious about reestablishing diplomatic ties with our neighbours. So it is undeniable that we will have to follow the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe foreign minister has come forth with two proposals:\n1. We can accept the Treaty of Versailles and gradually repay our loans with our newfound economic prosperity. Eventually this would lead to us fully-integrated into the western, democratic world. We would still suffer the limitations on our armed forces, though.\n2. We could, through diplomacy and negotiation, gradually try to rid us of the entire treaty's terms and reestablish a strong military. This would come at the cost of not being able to gain the benefits of being a modern, western country with good relations to the French, British and Americans."

 GER_unions.1.t:0 "Settle the Ownership Question"
 GER_unions.1.desc:0 "In the last 60 years, most, if not all, unions have been led by the workers themselves or their representatives. This has proven that the workers are willing and able to stand up for themselves and get their demands by striking or other measures.\n\nHowever, not many states of the last 60 years had the opportunity to create a state for the workers. We could step in there and create a supreme, state-owned union that regulates all work to increase the standard of living for employees."

 GER_unions.2.t:0 "Unionise the Army?"
 GER_unions.2.desc:0 "Perhaps a radical approach to the organisation of the army, perhaps the next logical step for it. We cannot know until we have tried it out.\n\nHowever we decide, what is clear is that this would certainly increase the morale of the troops and disencourage political extremism among them as they would be much more closely integrated into [GER.GetAdjectiveCap] politics."
