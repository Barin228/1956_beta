  ALB_italian_influence_dec_ctg_desc:0 "It was in 1912 when fire arose across the Balkans, a bloody war had started, the first of many to come. This year marks the end of a great and long struggle of all Balkan peoples against the Ottomans, and as such is the year when the Albanian people were finally freed and the State of Albania was established. Italy, seeing Albania as a minor nation that holds such a strategic position in the region, has sought to influence Albania ever since, especially following the events of 1922 and Il Duce's rise to power."
