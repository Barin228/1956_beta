 # Events
  siam.1.t: "The Nonthaburi Speech"
  siam.1.d: "Pridi Banomyong, a member of the civilian wing of Khana Ratsadon, known for his radical ideas, sometimes close to Marxism, of land reforms, addressed today a speech in the city of Nonthaburi.\n"Dear people of Siam, our glorious revolution, which has made us transition from a decadent and outdated political system to a system where the people finally have their voice, seems to be undergoing a test today. I myself have noticed that within the same party from which I come, some elements would like to establish their own form of tyranny, with the difference that the King and the nobles would be replaced by Generals and soldiers. But I believe in the Siamese people, who will never let such a thing happen. We have defeated tyranny once, we shall defeat it again."\nMany believe that this speech was about Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, who became Prime Minister following a coup d'état against the former Prime Minister, Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, of whom Pridi was close, but who was accused of communism because of his reform plans. No one knows if this speech will have an impact or not, but we will have to keep an eye on Pridi"
  siam.1.a: "What Kind Of Damage Could A Simple Teacher Cause?"


  siam.2.t: "Radio Seriphaph"
  siam.2.d: "It seems that the Free Thai have managed to take control of a radio station in the north of the country, where they have the most control. They use it to broadcast their own radio, Radio Seriphaph, meaning "Radio Freedom", with virulent attacks against the regime, as well as a call to join them every time. Some of their broadcasts are also linked to the debate on how Siam should be reorganized once the government is defeated, where there is a clear schism between the Liberals and the Communists, who seem to be equal in terms of membership within the rebels."
  siam.2.a: "We Need To Shut It Down!"

  siam.3.t: "Ho-Chi-Minh's Invitation"
  siam.3.d: "Since the beginning of the process of drafting a new constitution for Siam, some members of the temporary government have expressed their admiration for the person of Ho-Chi-Minh, a famous Vietnamese revolutionary, whose struggle for Vietnam's independence has been compared many times to the struggle against Khana Ratsadon. Many have expressed their desire to be advised by the one considered to be the greatest and wisest Indochinese revolutionary.\nHowever, more moderate members expressed mistrust, citing the link between Ho and communism, and fearing that a visit on his part would lead a large part of the government and the population to want to adopt a revolution modelled on that of the Bolsheviks."
  siam.3.a: "Welcome, Uncle Ho!"
  siam.3.b: "We can't risk his presence"

  siam.4.t: "The Red March"
  siam.4.d: "It would seem that the simple transition to a parliamentary system was not enough. While it was supposed to be just another Monday, the Communist Party of Siam made a gigantic call for a revolt against capitalism, encouraging the inhabitants to seize the means of production by themselves. Pridi Phonmayong, who has since become the main thinker of the Communist Party, addressed a major speech to the crowd, stating that Siam now belongs to the workers.\nSeni Pramoj, seeing the extent of the protests, but refusing to follow the communist system, was forced to resign, and it is said that he took a plane with his family to the United States. Phonmayong, said the Communist Party of Siam single party and announced the establishment of a new political system \"More suited to our revolution\""
  siam.4.a: "Long Live The Revolution!"

  siam.5.t: "The Declaration of the Republic"
  siam.5.d: "Direk Jayanama, Head of the Provisional Government, addressed the crowd in Bangkok today, gathered to attend his first speech as Head of Government.\n\"People of Siam, the blood of many of your brothers had to flow so that the rest of you could live in peace, and live free. It is for freedom that they fought and sacrificed themselves, and it is for these values that we shall honour them. People of Siam, freedom has triumphed over the darkness of tyranny, and I am proud to announce that we will build a republic based on our values for which we have proven our courage\"."
  siam.5.a: "Long live the Republic!"

  siam.6.t: "A Weapon Warehouse Raided!"
  siam.6.d: "During the night, one of our main weapons warehouses, located not far from Bangkok, was attacked by rebels, identified as belonging to the Free Thais. It would appear that most of the guards were killed discreetly, as the alarm was never triggered, which also implied that there had to be an ally among the guards. The warehouse was completely emptied, taking rifle and ammunition with them."
  siam.6.a: "This Does Not Bode Well..."

  siam.7.t: "A Letter From Pridi"
  siam.7.d: "One of the army generals went to Prime Minister Phot Phahonyothin to tell him of his fears about a potential infiltration of the army by anti-government revolutionaries. He claims to have found in one of the dormitories a message written by Pridi Banomyong. This message encouraged soldiers to peacefully oppose the government, declaring their refusal to be commanded by what they call "an adaptation of fascism".\nThe general suggested using this letter as a justification to arrest Pridi Banomyong for inciting disorder, and to try to prevent ideas of rebellion from spreading"
  siam.7.a: "We'll Show Him What We Do To Pseudo-Revolutionaries"

  siam.8.t: "The Sakhrai Incident"
  siam.8.d: "Last night, a police station in a village in the north-eastern district of Sakhrai was attacked by a gang of ten armed men. The two police officers present apparently disappeared, killed or abducted, and the attackers left the scene a few minutes later, according to a witness who had managed not to be seen. He says he heard one of the men complain about the absence of an official radio station.\nThe news of this attack provoked many reactions within the government, some thinking that they could have been inspired by Pridi Banomyong's call for resistance, which the authorities are still looking for but which remains unaccounted for. Rumours are circulating that a vast resistance network is being set up, and Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena has announced his intention to increase the number of police officers in the region."
  siam.8.a: "Hopefully It Was Only An Isolated Act"

  siam.9.t: "The Free Thais"
  siam.9.d: "While it was only supposed to be one afternoon like any other, a very special message could be heard on military radio:\n"We are the Free Thai movement. The soldiers of Khana Ratsadon are traitors, who used the revolution to make their own tyranny prevail instead of that of the King. We want to bring justice and democracy to our nation, and we will not hesitate in any way to finally give the Siamese people freedom. If you are an ally of the government, you are our enemy. If you are against it, you are our ally. We do not want to hurt any innocent people, but to prevent our beautiful nation from falling into the trap of fascism. We have seen what happened in Italy, Germany or Hungary. Terror, hatred, fanaticism and despair reign. We want to avoid this fate for our beautiful country, and build a new government that would act with the intention of meeting the needs of the people, for we are the people."\nThe voice heard was none other than that of Direk Jayanama, another former member of the Khana Ratsadon's civilian wing, who had become one of the main critics of the manhunt against Pridi Banomyong. It seems that he has decided to join the latter in an attempt to bring down the government through a large-scale revolt. We are currently unaware of their numbers, and it seems that they are mainly hiding in the northeast of the country, making it difficult to track them down."
  siam.9.a: "Then We Shall Wage War Against Them!"

  siam.10.t: "The Dibabha Rebellion"
  siam.10.d: "What should have been a simple insurrection has turned into a real rebellion. Declaring that he had found a letter from the Prime Minister to several members of Khana Ratsadon, indicating his ambitions to abolish the monarchy in the coming months, Prince Aditya Dibabha, who had been regent on behalf of Rama VIII, made a great appeal to the rebellion to "all those still loyal to the king". Many thought it would be crushed in the same way as Prince Boworadet's 1933 rebellion, which had failed because the Bangkok garrisons refused to join him.\nBut this time it was not the case. The garrison immediately left to join the rebels, who were able to take control of Bangkok within a few hours.\nThe main members of the former government, in particular Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, the Prime Minister, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram, were arrested and are awaiting trial, and the Prince declared the abolition of the 1932 Constitution, and his intention to restore the monarchy to it's rightful spot."

  siam.11.t: "The Battle Of Bangkok"
  siam.11.d: "The final battle against the regime is launched. Following the "Declaration of Revolt", issued by Pridi Banomyong himself to all Free Thais from Radio Seriphaph, the vast majority of rebels converged on Bangkok, hoping to take control of the government authorities. Two thirds of the militias attacked the city from the north, while the rest came from the east, with a small group apparently trying to attack from the ports using boats obtained as a result of a navy mutiny. Meanwhile, the government-loyal army, led by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, has deployed in the city, where a curfew has been decreed until further notice, and the aircraft is preparing to take off to provide reconnaissance support. The fate of Siam will be decided in the next few days..."
  siam.11.a: "Let's End This!"

  siam.12.t: "The Return Of Rama VII"
  siam.12.d: "Rama VII, who was still in exile in Europe, agreed to return to Siam and regain his throne. When he arrived at Bangkok airport, a huge crowd awaited him, chanting slogans to the glory of the king and the monarchy. Prince Aditya Dibabha, Head of the Provisional Government, was also present and accompanied Rama VII until the coronation ceremony a few hours later.\nRama VII is therefore once again king of Siam, and has announced his intention to re-implement the reforms he had put in place before the 1932 coup, notably the Supreme Council, and his intention to set up greater decentralization of the administration."

  siam.13.t: "The Monarchy Question"
  siam.13.d: "Officially, Siam has been a constitutional monarchy since the 1932 coup d'état, and the king continues to have some power over the government. But since the abdication of Prajadhipok, also known as Rama VII, following disagreement with the military who had become the main force of politics, Siam found itself without a king. His successor, Ananda Mahidol or Rama VIII, is only a child studying in Switzerland, and his regents have only a very limited influence. However, some members of the government fear that in the long term, the new king would risk putting batons in the wheels of the military again, and have therefore suggested abolishing the monarchy. But the abolition of an institution as important as the monarchy should not be taken lightly..."
  siam.13.a: "For The Good Of The Country, It Must Be Kept"
  siam.13.b: "We No Longer Need It"

  siam.14.t: "Constitutional Restoration Of Rama VII"
  siam.14.d: "Following a popular referendum in which more than half of the people decided to restore King Rama VII to his throne, he arrived at Bangkok airport two days later, welcomed by Prime Minister Seni Pramoj. A few hours later, his coronation ceremony took place, having sworn to respect the limits imposed by the new Siamese constitution."
  siam.14.a: "Long Live The King! Long Live The Constitution!"

  siam.15.t: "Victory Of The Rebels!"
  siam.15.d: "The Battle of Bangkok raged for days on end, with guns and rifles never stopping firing, soldiers and rebels fighting from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Following the takeover of the National Assembly building, the last government forces agreed to lay down their arms. According to some soldiers, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who commanded the anti-revolutionary troops, chose to commit suicide rather than witness the defeat of his own forces. Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, the former Prime Minister, apparently managed to take a ship and flee to Cambodia. Pridi Banomyong, leader of the revolutionaries, addressed a speech on the radio.\n\"Dear people of Siam, military tyranny is now behind us. The people have shown that, despite all the repression and fighting, they can maintain their determination and defeat the oppressor. From now on, power will be handed over to the people, the peasant, the worker, they will finally be liberated. We are at the dawn of the new era, we are walking towards a bright and hopeful future\""
  siam.15.a: "Hurray For The Revolution!"

  siam.16.t: "The Creation of the Socialist Republic of Siam"
  siam.16.d: "It is now time to officially declare Siam as a Republic that will follow Socialist thought. What Lenin has achieved in Russia, we will achieve here in Siam, we will build a new nation, free from the chains of capitalism."
  siam.16.a: "The Red Star Rises On Siam"
  siam.18.t: "Plaek Phibunsongkhram Elected Prime Minister"
  siam.18.d: "It seems that Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena is no longer in a position to lead the country. A scandal has just struck him: he reportedly sold royal goods to officers at much lower prices than usual. In addition, its supporters found themselves in a minority in the Popular Assembly following the first direct elections. Finally, his cabinet was unable to pass a budget reform, and collapsed. New elections have been held, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram has been chosen to lead the country"
  siam.18.a: "A Man With Great Ambitions"

  siam.19.t: "Rebels Occupy Isan"
  siam.19.d: "The Free Thais rebels launched a major offensive in Isan, and succeeded in capturing the important city of Nakhon Ratchasima, the largest in the region. Now bordering Laos, many fear that the rebels will try to establish links with Pathet Lao, or even the Việt Minh.\nPlaek Phibunsongkhram, Minister of Defence, suggested using reconnaissance to locate their main bases and then bombarding them from the air to affect their morals, but an action like this on our own soil and people could have very strong repercussions...."

  siam.20.d: "Our air raid over Isan managed to damage two of the rebel training camps, but also what seemed to be their headquarters. This morning, on Radio Seriphaph, Direk Jayanama announced that Pridi Banomyong had been killed by the air raids, and that it was up to him to "Complete the task that this great man will see us accomplish from heaven" The loss of the rebel leader does not seem to have diminished their morale, even worse, it is said that many farmers have decided to join them following the loss of their cultures following the air raids which caused many fires"

Direk Jayanama, leader of the Seri Thais, who founded the \"People's Radical Party\", taking as an example the French Radicalism as well as the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who wants to set up a state intervention in the economy to guarantee the well-being of the people. On the other hand, Seni Pramoj, another member of the Seri Thais, founded the conservative \"Democratic Party\", Seni himself being of royal heritage, he would like to restore the monarchy, while limiting it much more than what the first revolutionaries had done in 1932. Economically, he is much closer to Brittanic Tories, and believes that a non-interventionist economic policy would be beneficial to the nation and the people."
